# Final-Project : My Travel Bucketlist

I am making this project as a part of my course IMT 549. 
The purpose of this website is to kind of having a list of all the destinations I want to travel to, once the lockdown ends and after I graduate. The list provides city name, country name and cost of one person in USD per week.
